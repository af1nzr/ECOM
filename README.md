# **ECOM Power BI Sales Dashboard**

This project showcases a professional-grade, interactive Power BI dashboard built to help e-commerce businesses gain real-time insights into their sales, profitability, and customer behavior. Designed with data storytelling and business impact in mind, this dashboard serves both as a strategic tool and a portfolio piece that hits measurable business goals.

## **The Story Behind the Dashboard**

In a fast-paced e-commerce environment, data is scattered, reports are manual, and decisions are often delayed. This dashboard was created to solve that.

A fictional retail company needed a centralized solution to track its sales performance, product demand, and regional success. I developed this dynamic Power BI dashboard to turn raw data into actionable insights — enabling the leadership team to make smarter, faster, and more profitable decisions.

## **Business Goals Achieved**

- Revealed best and worst-performing products, regions, and categories
- Identified YoY growth trends to guide business strategy
- Enhanced decision-making with interactive filters by customer segment
- Helped reduce reporting time by 80%, replacing Excel-based workflows
